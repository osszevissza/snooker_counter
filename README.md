# Snooker Counter App

The main goal of this calculator is to keep track of the frame's score during play, with its main value being the change in difference - remaining.
Therefore, the two main considerations were that it should be:
•	Usable over a snooker stream
•	Causes minimal distraction on the screen
(I also had a Javascript - PWA version, but I quickly realized that a PWA doesn't work on Firefox. Plus, it was too bulky even at its smallest size. The PySide version is a much better fit.)

# Features
•	It keeps a running tally of the remaining red balls.
•	It simply calculates the score and doesn't enforce the sequence of shots.
•	An undo button is planned for a future update.

# Getting Started
This calculator was created with PySide6.
To use the source code, you'll need to install PySide6. You can do this by running the following command:
pip install PySide6
